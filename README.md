# ETL-pipeline-with-PostgreSQL

To run the pipeline locally just pull repo on your local maching and run the command "bash run_pipeline.sh" in your terminal. 
This crates connection to a PostgreSQL server (you should create the server beforehead), creates tables, extracts, processes and insers data into those tables.

You can check results with text.ipynb.

### This pipeline can be used as the baseline for bigger project which requires interaction with PostgreSQL server.
